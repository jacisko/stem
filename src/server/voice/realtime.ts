// Voice chat: OpenAI's realtime voice model on the user's ChatGPT subscription.
//
// The client owns the audio (a WebRTC peer connection with the microphone and
// an `oai-events` data channel); the server only answers its SDP offer, so the
// ChatGPT token never leaves this process and a thin client reaches it through
// the ordinary /rpc channel. The realtime model is only the voice: every real
// request goes back through its `ask_stem` tool, which the client runs as an
// ordinary turn in the open chat (memory, personas, tools, transcript).
//
// Money: measured 2026-10-25, a ChatGPT-token realtime call draws on the
// plan's Codex usage budget and left the account's paid credit balance
// untouched. Past the plan's limit OpenAI bills credits instead, so every
// connect — and the client's periodic check during a call — refuses once the
// plan window is spent, or when it cannot be read at all.
